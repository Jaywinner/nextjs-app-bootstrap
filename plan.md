# Plan for Enhancing the Cybersecurity Learning Discord Bot

## File Structure and Overview
- **bot.py**: Main entry point to initialize the bot, register commands, and handle interactions.
- **database.py**: Manages the SQLite database connection, schema (users, achievements, course_progress), and helper functions.
- **courses.py**: Contains course content (modules, lessons, quizzes) stored as Python dictionaries or loaded from JSON and functions to retrieve them.
- **admin.py**: Implements admin-only commands for adding/updating courses and lessons.
- **quiz.py**: Handles interactive quiz functionality with button-based multiple-choice questions and real-time feedback.
- **achievements.py**: Manages achievement/badge awarding and retrieval functions, including course completion certificates.

## Detailed File Changes and Enhancements

### bot.py
1. **Initialization & Security**  
   - Import `os`, `discord`, `discord.ext.commands`, and submodules from custom files (database, courses, admin, quiz, achievements).  
   - Load the bot token securely from environment variables using `os.environ.get("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")`.
2. **Bot Setup & Commands**  
   - Initialize the bot with necessary intents (including `message_content`).  
   - Register common commands:  
     - `!start`: Displays an introductory course embed (fetched from courses.py) with a button ("Begin Lesson").  
     - `!leaderboard`: Retrieves and displays top learners using database functions.
     - `!quiz`: Initiates a quiz for the current lesson/module.
     - `!achievements`: Displays earned badges and course completions.
3. **Interaction & Error Handling**  
   - Implement button callbacks using `discord.ui.View` to deliver lesson content interactively.  
   - Wrap command logic in try/except blocks and send user-friendly error messages.

### database.py
1. **Database Setup**  
   - Establish a connection to `academy.db` and initialize tables:  
     - `users`: (user_id, xp, level)  
     - `achievements`: (id, user_id, achievement_name, date_awarded)  
     - Optionally, `course_progress`: (user_id, course_id, module_id, lesson_id, status)
2. **Helper Functions**  
   - `add_xp(user_id, amount)`, `get_xp(user_id)`, and `update_level(user_id)` for XP and leveling.  
   - Functions in achievements.py to add and fetch achievements.
3. **Error Management**  
   - Use try/except for all database operations and ensure transactions are committed.

### courses.py
1. **Content Storage**  
   - Define a structured Python dictionary (or load a JSON file) with courses, modules, lessons, and quiz questions.
2. **Content Retrieval Functions**  
   - Functions such as `get_course(course_id)`, `get_module(course_id, module_id)`, and `get_lesson(course_id, module_id, lesson_id)` to fetch data.
3. **Robust Error Checks**  
   - Return meaningful error messages if requested content is missing.

### admin.py
1. **Admin Command Implementation**  
   - Create commands like `!admin_add_course` and `!admin_update_course` safeguarded with admin role checks or specific user IDs.
2. **Interactive Updates**  
   - Use embeds and button inputs (or modal dialogs) to accept new course/lesson content from admins.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**  
   - Confirm successful additions/updates with verbose embed messages.

### quiz.py
1. **Interactive Quiz Flow**  
   - Implement a quiz command that, upon invocation, fetches quiz questions associated with the current lesson.
2. **Button-Based UI**  
   - Create a `discord.ui.View` with buttons for multiple-choice answers.
3. **Answer Validation & Feedback**  
   - In the button callback, check the answer, award XP on correct answers (using database functions), and provide immediate, ephemeral feedback.
4. **Error Handling**  
   - Gracefully handle unexpected inputs and retry attempts.

### achievements.py
1. **Achievement Management**  
   - Develop functions to check and award achievements when users hit XP milestones or complete courses.
2. **User Achievement Display**  
   - Create a command `!achievements` that queries the database and displays earned badges in an embed.
3. **Certificate Generation**  
   - On course completion, send a congratulatory message via DM with details of the certificate (text-based since no external images will be used).

## Additional Considerations
- **UI/UX Design**:  
  - Utilize Discord embeds with modern color themes and clear typography.  
  - Design buttons with descriptive labels (e.g., “Begin Lesson”, “Submit Answer”) ensuring clarity and responsiveness.
- **Best Practices & Error Handling**:  
  - Secure sensitive data via environment variables.  
  - Wrap asynchronous operations and database calls in try/except for robust error management.
- **Integration & Testing**:  
  - Each command and module should be tested in a Discord test server with simulated interactions, ensuring proper XP updates, quiz validations, and admin command security.

## Summary
- The project will be structured into separate Python modules for main bot functions, database management, course content, admin controls, quizzes, and achievements.  
- The enhanced features include multi-module courses, interactive quizzes, XP/level tracking, achievement awards, and admin-driven content updates.  
- Each file includes robust error handling and secure token management via environment variables.  
- Modern, clear embeds and button-based interactions ensure a rich, interactive learning experience within Discord.  
- All interactions are designed to be user-friendly, with ephemeral feedback where appropriate.
